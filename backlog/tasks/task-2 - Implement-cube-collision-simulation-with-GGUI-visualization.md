## Description

Create an interactive cube collision simulation demonstrating elastic collision between two cubes using Taichi's GGUI for real-time visualization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Working cube collision simulation with GGUI
- [x] Auto-looping simulation
- [x] Interactive controls for adjusting parameters
- [x] 5x5x5 particles per cube with 90% overlap

## Implementation Notes

Implemented multiple versions of cube collision simulation:
- elastic_cube_collision.py: Differentiable version with optimization (incomplete due to autodiff issues)
- elastic_cube_collision_simple.py: Basic non-differentiable version for testing
- cube_collision_demo.py: Parameter sweep demonstration
- cube_collision_ggui_simple.py: Interactive GGUI visualization with auto-looping

Final version features:
- 5x5x5 particles per cube (250 total)
- 90% overlap collision configuration
- Auto-looping after 1000 timesteps
- Interactive controls (Up/Down for velocity, Space to reset)
- CPU mode for stability
- 24x24x24 grid simulation domain (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 unit cube)
